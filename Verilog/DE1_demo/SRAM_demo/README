SRAM_demo
----------------

Simple demo using the onboard SRAM.

SW[9] is write enable (active low /WE)
SW[8:0] are address
KEY[3:0] are data

It degrades without power.

The IC is the IS61LV25616 
"256K x 16 HIGH SPEED ASYNCHRONOUS CMOS STATIC RAM WITH 3.3V SUPPLY"
according to the datasheet supplied by the altera kit. It has great timing diagrams pretty standard SRAM.
