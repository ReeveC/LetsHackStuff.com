OTP
---

Basic system for implementing a one time password login.

How it works
------------

Server stores username and h(username.password) where h() is a one-way 
hash function, this is the HASH. On login the server sends a challenge, 
in this case the first 10 bytes of md5(mt_rand()). The reply is 
g(HASH.challenge).

In this implementation h() and g() are sha512 and of the reply only the 
first 10 chars are used.
